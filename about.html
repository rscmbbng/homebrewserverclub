	<H2>What</H2>
A monthly gathering for those who (wish to) host their own online services from home,
rather than using commercial and privacy unfriendly alternatives.
We recognize that every home brew server is unique because it reflects the specific skills and
needs of it's owner(s). Therefor the homebrew server club is not so much
about teaching you how to install a specific software but rather to share
the different strategies and approaches one can take when
building, maintaining and using one's own server. How to best use
spare hardware, how to be as power-efficient as possible, how to deal
with asynchronous bandwidth and how this all impacts the uses and
aesthetics of the server, services and websites that it might host.

	<H2>This Server</H2>
	The machine that hosts homebrewserver.club is passed along to a different member after each meeting and set up to be hosted at his or her place. The homebrewserver.club announces its new address on <a href="https://twitter.com/HBServerClub">https://twitter.com/HBServerClub</a>.

	The <a href="http://vj14.stdin.fr/Summit_afterlife.xhtml">Feminist Server Manifesto 0.01</a>

	<pre>
	From the feminist server manifesto:
	- Setup local server(s) & make our own network infrastructure, rather than "fixing the problems of internet access" by paying for increased bandwidth.
	- Prefer "read/write" networks to those that "just work".
	- Prefer pocket servers to those in the clouds.
	- Embrace a diversity of network topologies, uses and different scales (machine to machine, local nodes, institutional infrastructure) and consider the implications of working with each, rather than a Web 2.0 model where resources must be uploaded onto "the 24/7 Internet (tm)" in order to share them.
	- Invite users to look critically at the implications of any infrastructural decisions, rather than imagining utopic and/or "killer" solutions.
